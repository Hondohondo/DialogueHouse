Master Template:

After setting up the normal html boiler plate, CSS and BEM..

Setting up Node, NPM and Sass:

1. Make sure you have Node installed... (verify by checking "node-v" on terminal)
2. Then "npm init" in order to create package.json file
3. Install Node sass by writing on terminal "npm install node-sass --save-dev" , 
we used save-dev in order to save it as devlopment dependency in our package.json file (which means is it's a development tool
that will help us build our project)...Also by saving it means we can share our file without sharing our node modules folder.
If someone receive our project they can just "npm install" on terminal then all dependencies will be automatically installed
